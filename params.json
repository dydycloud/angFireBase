Remember the name you use for the Firebase, you’ll use it in a second.\r\n\r\nAt the end of app/js/config.js, change the .constant() line and add in your Firebase URL:\r\n\r\napp/js/config.js\r\n\r\n  // your Firebase URL goes here\r\n  // should look something like: https://blahblah.firebaseio.com\r\n  .constant('FBURL', 'FIREBASE_URL_GOES_HERE')\r\n\r\nGreat! You should now be able to boot the skeleton of the application. \r\n\r\n \r\nStart the server from the app/ directory with node scripts/web-server.js\r\n\r\n \r\nNavigate to 'localhost:8000/app/index.html' to see it in action!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
